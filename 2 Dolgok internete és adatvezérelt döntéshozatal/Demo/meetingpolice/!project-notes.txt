This project implements a "meeting room guard" - supposedly to guard meeting rooms from being used without having been properly reserved first.
It measures humidity in the air (to detect humans).
Measurements are continuously uploaded into the cloud.
If humidity rises above a threshold, the device displays a "local warning" to scare off any intruders.
Using the admin portal, a warning signal can also be sent to the device to activate the "cloud warning".

A good way to finish this demo is to route the events arriving in the IoT Hub, via a Stream Analytics job, into Power BI, where they arrive onto a dashboard that updates real-time.

(Dashboard updates seem to happen every 10-20 seconds.)
